Exercise - Text guardrails


Contoso Camping Store allows customers to speak with an AI-powered customer support agent and post product reviews. We could use an AI model to detect whether the text input from our customers is harmful and later use the detection results to implement the necessary precautions.


1) Safe content


Let’s first test positive customer feedback.

2) Harmfull content

Let’s test with some negative customer feedback.

text : I recently bought a tent, and I have to say, I'm really disappointed. The tent poles seem flimsy, and the zippers are constantly getting stuck. It's not what I expected from a high-end tent. You all suck and are a sorry excuse for a brand.
